    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is <a href='http://dbinetti.com'>David Binetti</a> and a six-time entrepreneur and consultant.  I built this app to manage my own companies's cap tables since I
        found Excel too constrained and my lawyer's too expenive.</P>
    <p>I hope you find it useful.  Good luck with your venture!</P>
